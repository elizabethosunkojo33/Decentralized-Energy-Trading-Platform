# Decentralized Energy Trading Platform

A blockchain-based platform enabling peer-to-peer energy trading, smart grid management, and IoT device integration for sustainable energy distribution.

## Overview

The Decentralized Energy Trading Platform revolutionizes traditional energy markets by enabling direct peer-to-peer energy trading. Users can buy, sell, and trade energy units while the platform ensures efficient grid management and real-time monitoring through IoT integration.

## Core Components

### Energy Token Contract
- Implements ERC-20 compatible energy tokens
- Each token represents a standardized unit of energy
- Supports minting based on energy production
- Includes burning mechanism for energy consumption
- Built-in verification of energy source credentials

### Grid Management Contract
- Real-time monitoring of grid capacity and load
- Automated load balancing algorithms
- Dynamic pricing based on supply and demand
- Emergency protocols for grid stability
- Historical data storage for analysis and optimization

### Peer-to-Peer Trading Contract
- Automated matching of buyers and sellers
- Order book management system
- Price discovery mechanism
- Escrow functionality for secure transactions
- Dispute resolution system

### Smart Meter Integration Contract
- IoT device registration and authentication
- Real-time energy consumption/production data collection
- Automated token minting based on production
- Automated payment processing
- Data validation and verification mechanisms

## Technical Requirements

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Web3.js or ethers.js for frontend integration
- Node.js â‰¥14.0.0
- Hardhat development environment
- OpenZeppelin smart contract library

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/energy-trading-platform.git

# Install dependencies
cd energy-trading-platform
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage

### Deploying Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### Interacting with the Platform

1. Connect your wallet (MetaMask recommended)
2. Register your smart meter device
3. Start trading energy tokens
4. Monitor your energy production/consumption

## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts have undergone thorough security audits
- Regular security updates and maintenance
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Rate limiting to prevent network congestion
- Comprehensive access control implementation
